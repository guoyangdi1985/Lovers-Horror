# Lovers-Horror
Special Thanks to my former teammates, Tacia Small and Lekai Zheng! The reason I pushed this project is that I wanna rework on it someday. Loverâ€™s horror is an interactive fiction game made in Twine with the SugarCube format. It combines love and horror. It is a simulator style adventure story that gives the player experiences in love and horror. This game is based in Statesville,NC, the home of a mysterious abandoned hospital. The way this game addresses the class theme is to provide players with a constrained game environment where the players can still make some choices by themselves to experience narrative of the game and gameplay.
